But now to another story that may leave you feel equally dirty . The automated space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 collided with an asteroid on its way to the Jupiter moon Ganymede . According to the ship owner the ship is out of control and leaking its content into space. ” <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s right , Fred . And the content of the ship has it in it , as they say ” , the computer said in first voice again , “ The whole tanker was filled with ‘ biological waste products ’ coming from research and mining stations in the Kuiper Belt. ” <newline> <newline> “ Biological waste products ? You don ’ t mean ... ” <newline> <newline> “ Yes , Fred ! ” Dramatic pause . “ I am talking about poop . Lots of it . And apparently it ’ s spilling everywhere. ” <newline> <newline> “ Better call the plumbers , Frank. ” <newline> <newline> “ Not any time soon , Fred . A spokesperson of the ship owner stated and I quote – ‘ Space is kind of big and empty , we expect no one to care , so why should we ? ’ Apparently they will just build a new ship and be done with it. ” <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s one way not to deal with the problem . But why doesn ’ t the ship fly home ? Shouldn ’ t the AI on board be able to handle such a problem ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , the issue is that the part in charge to deal with asteroid impacts like that has been impacted by the asteroid. ” <newline> <newline> “ Ouch . Talk about a bad run. ” <newline> <newline> “ True , especially if you take the name of the ship in consideration. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh ? Exxon Valdez 2.0 it was , isn ’ t that right , Frank ? ” <newline> <newline> “ You ’ re absolutely right , Fred . Did you know the ship was named after an infamous ship of the twentieth century back on old Earth ? Apparently the Exxon Valdez of old was used for transporting petroleum across the oceans of Earth . Petroleum , as some of our listeners might not know , was a brownish black , gooey liquid comprised of biological matter which was transformed under high pressure for millions of years . Quite ironically the Exxon Valdez was infamous for crashing and spilling its cargo. ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , talk about making a bad name for yourself . Now both ships will go down in history for spilling black gooey stuff where it doesn ’ t belong . Who had that bright idea for such a name anyway ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , Fred , the company made its first plunder by holding a naming contest on the internet. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh , will they ever learn ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Apparently not , Fred . Predictably someone tried to make a joke out of it . A niche side of history role players got wind of the contest and made it its goal to get it named after the infamous Exxon Valdez . Apparently they thought it would be funny , and given the content both ships were ferrying around , they might have a point. ” <newline> <newline> “ Funny , indeed , Frank . What ’ s the name of the side ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , Fred , it ’ s called Reddit . The people there mostly talk in outdated lingo and memes and watch cat pictures back from a time when the internet only was local on Earth. ” <newline> <newline> “ Truly a herald of the dark ages. ” <newline> <newline> “ You might be right about that , Fred . I assume they just thought it was funny . I guess this happens , when you let the internet decide on things. ” <newline> <newline> “ Well , Frank , when you think about the content both ships were ferrying around , they might have been right . Embarrassing for the company , but funny for everyone else. ” <newline> <newline> “ It might get worse than that , Fred . Environmentalists are up in arms . They claim that the human waste products spilling out of the ship might collide with Jupiter ’ s moon Europa within the next few millennia and might contaminate the biospheres with Earth life . Apparently there are a lot of bacteria and the likes in poop and some might be able survive the harsh conditions of space and end up impacting on the restricted moon. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh dear , Frank , does the Monolith know about it yet ? I am sure it won ’ t let us hear the end of it. ” <newline>
